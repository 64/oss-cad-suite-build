OSS CAD Suite
=============

Installation
------------

1. Download an archive matching your OS from the releases page at https://github.com/YosysHQ/oss-cad-suite-build/releases/latest.
2. Extract the archive to a location of your choice (for Windows it is recommended that path does not contain spaces)
3. To use OSS CAD Suite 

Linux and macOS
---------------
export PATH="<extracted_location>/oss-cad-suite/bin:$PATH"

or

source <extracted_location>/oss-cad-suite/environment

Windows
-------
from existing shell:
<extracted_location>\oss-cad-suite\environment.bat

to create new shell window:
<extracted_location>\oss-cad-suite\start.bat

**NOTE:** when environment is set, `python3` from package becomes available as well, this enables usage of *nMigen* and *nMigen* 
HDL and *LiteX* libraries scripts as usual, when OSS CAD Suite is just added in PATH to use packaged python3 use `tabbypy3` to 
start python environment. For Windows, there are no wrappers and using environment.bat is only choice.
